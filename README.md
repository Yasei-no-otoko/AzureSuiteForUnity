# Azure Cognitive Services for Unity
This is a suite of code I've been using to plug Unity into Azure Cognitive Services.  The aim is to have a full suite of all the cognitive services, firstly accessible through code, but secondly accessible in a more Unity/Beavhiour driven way.

Some of this is simple such as sending text to services, others are more complex, such as sending images, audio, or video, and having them encoded the right way.

## The Aim
The aim of this project is two fold:
* Editor Support - Allow developers to leverage Azure Cognitive Services in their tool chain, bringing AI to game development.
* In Game Support - Allow develoeprs to leverage Azure Cognitive Serviecs easily in their games.  In some cases near zero-code integration if possible.  
* For both - Simply import the same package.

None of the code is presuming to be the 'best way'.  So if you know a better way, feel free to contribute.  Azure Cognitive Services in the past has had new features at a rate that if it continues, I'm going to need help keeping this up to date.
